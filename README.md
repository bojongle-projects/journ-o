# üëÄ¬†Problem

I possess a deep-seated disdain for modern western ‚Äújournalism‚Äù

I am disgusted by the low-effort content we are fed on such a regular basis

Most journalists seem to put little to no effort into conveying facts

Few journalists are pursuing valuable stories that need to be shared

Most journalism has a heavy focus on getting clicks

Some of the websites even have the audacity to try and charge you a subscription for their dogshit excuse for ‚Äúnews‚Äù

I can do it better.

Background/Context

- When is the last time you clicked on a Washington post article and felt like you took something away from that?
- [Modern American journalists take their position for granted. They do not use the platform they have been given to spread any real knowledge, instead opting to peddle irrelevant nonsense](https://kotaku.com/gtav-s-enhanced-2022-release-should-leave-the-2013-tran-1847723098)
- They will weaponize their platform against those they disagree with
- They will put out misleading or malicious articles about public figures purely for clicks
- [They often play the moral high ground after participating in brutal witchhunts and inciting mob mentality which they will direct towards their victims whether intentional or unintentional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessi_Slaughter_cyberbullying_case)

# üí≠¬†Proposal

> To Demonstrate the absurdity of modern-day journalism
> 

Create a machine learning model to generate legitimate fake news

The end product should be a full news article will all typically text elements present

1. Quotes
2. References to research (can be real or fake)

# üõ´¬†Plan

1. For this project, I will be using [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/) as the machine learning framework
    
    The reason I am choosing TensorFlow is that I know it‚Äôs based on python and I am decent at python
    
    I have minimal experience with TensorFlow but some are better than none
    

**Hardware**

This model will be housed on-prem at my house

It will be made using 12 [Libre computer Le Potatoe](https://libre.computer/products/aml-s905x-cc/) single board computers

They have a Mali-450 GPU

**Data**

Data will be gathered from [kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com/)

Kaggle is a large dataset hosting service, think of it as a hub for data to feed machine learning algorithms.

Data will be gathered from many many categories

Educational to form some kind of knowledge of the world

Social data to vaguely understand social norms

Sentiment studies to determine the mood and read into the ‚Äúsubtext‚Äù of what a person is saying

**Disguise**

This ‚Äújournalist‚Äù has to look at least semi-legit.

For this, I will be building up a fake social media presence

This will likely include botting Instagram and Twitter followers

faking a Twitter history

Faking documents, such as a degree

Building a website, also with history on it
